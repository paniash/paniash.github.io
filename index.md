@def title = "Ashish Panigrahi"

Hello there!

My name is Ashish Panigrahi. I'm a 3rd year physics major studying under the Integrated Master's programme at the [National Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhubaneswar, India](https://www.niser.ac.in).

I like to read [books](books/) and occasionally write [code](https://github.com/paniash) during my leisure hours. I am a strong proponent of GNU/Linux, using free (as in freedom), open-source and privacy-respecting software over proprietary ones.

If you have any questions, suggestions, advice or simply wish to discuss about topics that relate to me, feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:ashish.panigrahi@niser.ac.in).

For academic details, see my [resume](assets/files/resume.pdf).
