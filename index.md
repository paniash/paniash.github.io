# Ashish Panigrahi

### Physics student for life

Hello there!

I'm Ashish Panigrahi, a 3rd year physics major studying under the Integrated Master's programme at the [National Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhubaneswar, India](https://www.niser.ac.in). I am interested in quantum physics with its application in algorithms and error-mitigation for [NISQ](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00862) devices and beyond.

I like to learn and tinker with software and occasionally write [code](https://github.com/paniash) (in Python and C) during my leisure hours. I am a strong proponent of GNU/Linux, using free (as in freedom), open-source and privacy-respecting software over proprietary ones like Windows, Google and other tech giants.

If you have any questions, suggestions, advice or simply wish to discuss about topics that relate to me, feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:ashish.panigrahi@niser.ac.in).

For academic details, see my [resume](assets/files/cv.pdf).
